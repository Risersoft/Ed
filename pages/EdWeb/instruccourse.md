video before uploading in order to speed up the process of uploading and downloading, as well as to save the internet.

## Hindi/Indian Languages

**Hindi or any Indian language Document or Presentation**

To upload a Hindi or any Indian language type of document, you need to execute the following steps to make the document unchanged after the upload.

**Embed fonts in Word or PowerPoint**

1.	Click the **File** tab and then click **Options** (it's near the bottom left corner of the window).
2.	In the left column, select the **Save** tab.
3.	At the bottom, under **Preserve fidelity when sharing this presentation**, select the **Embed fonts in the file check box**.

Selecting **Embed only the characters used in the presentation** reduces the file size but limits editing of the file using the same font. Leaving that check box blank increases the file size, but is best for allowing others to edit the document and keep the same font.

We recommend leaving the check box blank if the other person may edit the file.

4.	Click **OK**.
