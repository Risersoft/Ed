EdNirvana supports Hindi/Indian Language for Documents and PPTs, which allows coverage of different Subjects/Courses.

It automatically **converts the Document/PPT into PDF format without any loss of data**.

### Issue 

 **Data has been lost after uploading the Documents into EdNirvana**

*Uploaded PPT and its View after Conversion into PDF*:

### Solution

Now, the data loss issue has been resolved by using **syncfusion services** to convert data from PPT and Document into PDF.

**Note:** To upload a Hindi or any Indian language type of document, you need to follow the below steps to keep the document unchanged after the upload.

**Embed fonts in Word or PowerPoint**

1. Click the **File** tab and then click **Options** (itâ€™s near the bottom left corner of the window).

2. In the left column, select the **Save** tab.

3. At the bottom, under **Preserve fidelity when sharing this presentation**, select the **Embed fonts in the file check box**

Selecting **Embed only the characters used in the presentation** reduces the file size but limits editing of the file using the same font. Leaving that check box blank increases the file size, but is best for allowing others to edit the document and keep the same font.

We recommend leaving the check box blank if the other person may edit the file.

Click **OK**
